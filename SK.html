Career
2006–2012: Early career and introduction to cinema
Sivakarthikeyan took part in various cultural events and performed mimicry and standup comedy during his college years.[13] He took a three month-break in between studies, to take part in the auditions of Kalakka Povathu Yaaru?, a comedy reality TV show airing on Star Vijay, and won the second season of the competition in 2006.[14] The makers of Aegan (2008) noticed his performance and offered him a supporting role in the film, but his portions did not make the final cut.[15] He appeared in short films such as Mugaputhagam.[16]

Director Pandiraj approached Sivakarthikeyan to play the lead role in his film Marina (2012), and he signed the project. He prepared for the role by visiting Marina Beach extensively to study the surroundings, while revealing that he hoped that his natural talent of humor would come through onscreen.[17] Featuring alongside Oviya as a young couple in the film, Sivakarthikeyan's performance was well-received, with a critic noting "the romance adds colour to a monochrome film", while the reviewer also noted that the "role of Senthilnathan requires Siva to be just himself, it is just a cake walk in terms of performance for this actor."[18]

Aishwarya Rajinikanth signed up Sivakarthikeyan to play a supporting role as Dhanush's friend in 3, after being impressed with his work onstage as a host.[19] Though the film opened to mixed reviews, critics appreciatied Sivakarthikeyan's work as providing comic relief in a serious film.[20] He was next seen in Ezhil's romantic comedy Manam Kothi Paravai that released later that year. It opened to mixed reviews with a critic noting that the film "might not provide Sivakarthikeyan the platform he is aspiring for – lead roles in movies. But it does showcase his potential as an actor."[21]

2013–2019: Experimentation in genres and success
In 2013, Sivakarthikeyan appeared in three films. In his first release of the year, Kedi Billa Killadi Ranga, a dual hero coming-of-age comedy film, Sivakarthikeyan partnered once again with Pandiraj and acted alongside Vimal.[22] The film opened to positive reviews from critics,[23][24] and became a success at the box office.[25] His next film was Dhanush's debut production venture Ethir Neechal, written and directed by R. S. Durai Senthilkumar, a former assistant of director Vetrimaaran. It is a story about a young man having talent as a long-distance runner, who strives to make an identity for himself.[citation needed] His third release of the year was director Ponram's comedy Varuthapadatha Valibar Sangam, which saw Sivakarthikeyan portray a carefree rural youth and he was paired with newcomer Sri Divya, and Soori. Sivakarthikeyan sang a song in a film, the first of his career.[citation needed] He won positive reviews for his performance from critics, with Sify noting "Sivakarthikeyan is terrific as Bosepandi because he makes it look so believable on screen with his body language, eyes and dialogue delivery". Another reviewer called him a delight to watch and claimed that he carried the script.[26] The film completed 100 days during its theatrical run and was Sivakarthikeyan's biggest commercial box office success at that time.[27] His performances in 2013 led him to win the year's Vijay Award for Entertainer of the Year, an onstage moment which Sivakarthikeyan described as "memorable".[28]
